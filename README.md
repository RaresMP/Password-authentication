# Password-authentication
This is a Python function that prompts the user to enter a password and checks if it meets certain requirements.

This code follows a simple control flow: the function prompts the user to enter a password, checks if the password is correct, and either logs the user in (if the password is correct), informs the user their password is wrong (if the password is incorrect), or informs the user their password is too short (if the password is too short). The function limits the number of tries the user has to enter a password and informs them how many tries they have left if they still have tries remaining. Finally, if the user runs out of tries, the function informs them they can't try again until tomorrow.
